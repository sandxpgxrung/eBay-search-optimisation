This project entails around a proto-type web-application which mimics the search environment of an ecommerce platform. The solution is represented in the form of a specific search feature which enables users to find the maximum quantity of unique product(s) which they can obtain for a given price. The proposed solution is an innovative means of finding 'bang for a buck', as well as narrowing down search results to improve user-experience on the web. The core of this development strongly revolves around the application of genetic algorithms in opitmising combinatorial tasks. 

The 'main.py' contains the core source code for initiating this web-application.
